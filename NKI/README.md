# Enhanced Nathan Kline Institute - Rockland Sample 

From the [Enhanced Nathan Kline Institute - Rockland Sample](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/document/1200-subjects-data-release):

> The enhanced Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) is an ongoing, institutionally centered endeavor aimed at creating a large-scale (N > 1000) community sample of participants across the lifespan. Measures include a wide array of physiological and psychological assessments, genetic information, and advanced neuroimaging. Anonymized data will be publicly shared openly and prospectively (i.e., on a quarterly basis).

## Steps to produce this study's data dictionary

1. Make sure you have Matlab (built on 2022b)
2. [Download the zip of the Assessment Documentation](https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/enhanced/documentation.html) and unzip into the `NKI/` subfolder as a folder named `assessments_documentation`

Json of "QuestionID"s will output into the phenotypes directory!
