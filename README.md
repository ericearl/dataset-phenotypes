# "Big" Neuroimaging Dataset Phenotype BIDS Tools

Preparatory scripts to output BIDS phenotypic data dictionaries and transform phenotypic data to BIDS TSVs for common neuroimaging datasets.

These tools follow the guidelines of BIDS Extension Proposal 36 (BEP036). The hope is for researchers to embrace this BIDS Phenotypic Data standard, by seeing examples in their favorite datasets.
